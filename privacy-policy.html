<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This policy applies to all information requested or collected by Clone when interacting with the iOS application.</p>

<h2>Information we collect</h2>

<p>If you connect an external code hosting account (GitHub or BitBucket):</p>

<p>You may be asked for your account credentials. This information is used by to obtain an authorization token. Clone does not see your password when obtaining the token.</p>

<p>This authorization token is stored in the secure keychain on your device. It is not stored on our servers. It is only transmitted to the associated service in order to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listing your hosted repositories</li>
<li>Reading your name (for use in commit messages if you choose)</li>
<li>Reading your Email addres (for use in commit messages if you choose)</li>
<li>Creating repositories at your request</li>
<li>Uploading and checking SSH Keys</li>
</ul>

<p>At any time you choose, you may disconnect your external account or revoke the authorization from the service's website.</p>

<p>Your name, email address, and account information are only used for necessary app functions, and never collected or transmitted to our servers.</p>

<p>If you use HTTP or HTTPS to clone, push, or pull a repository:</p>

<p>You may be prompted for a username and password. These credentials are stored in the secure keychain on your device and are only used to authenticate with the associated repository. They are not transmitted to our servers.</p>

<p>If you use SSH to clone, push, or pull a repository:</p>

<p>Your SSH private key will be used to authenticate and encrypt communications with the remote server. Private keys are stored on-device and not transmitted.<p>

<h2>Information usage</h2>

<p>Your information is stored on your device and only used at your request in response to user actions. For example, your name and email address are stored, and used to provide authorship for your Git commits. If you push these commits to an external server, that server will receive your name and email address.

<p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.</p>

<p>All communication with code hosting service APIs uses HTTPS to access your repositories. If you choose to access a repository over http, it will be insecure. SSH Key authentication is encouraged</p>

<h2>Accessing your information</h2>

<p>You may access or change your information from the app, or may delete it by deleting the app. Your information is not stored outside of the app, so it can be removed at your decision.</p>

<h2>Third-party links and content</h2>

<p>Clone provides access to git repositories hosted by third party services, and allows you to upload your repositories to these services. These services have their own policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.</p>

<h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>

<h2>Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>

<h2>Contacting Us</h2>
