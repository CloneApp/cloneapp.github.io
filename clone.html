<h1>Clone</h1>

<h2><code>git remote add iphone|ipad|ipad-pro</code></h2>

<p>Clone brings the power of Git version control to iOS, in an intelligent package. With beautiful visualization, an advanced code editor, and intuitive git workflows, Clone makes git productivity mobile.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Top-notch visualization</h3>

<p>A graph is worth a thousand SHAs. Clone shows commit history beautifully and quickly, so you can <strong>see</strong> what that merge commit actually merges. See what changed in amy commit with diff views. For individual files a heat map (blame) shows the who, what and when for each part of the file when you're asking <strong>why</strong>.</p>

<h3>Designed for iPad Pro and iOS 9</h3>

<p>Clone works beautifully on all iOS devices, but bigger is better. With multitasking on iPad, you can work side-by-side. Write a blog post in Markdown from one app while previewing in Clone. Commit and push are just a tap away. Whatever the size, you're covered.</p>

<h3>A Code Editor tailored for git</h3>

<p>Be fearless with version control. Clone's text editor previews HTML and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>. It performs syntax highlighting in 30+ languages and displays line numbers. It's built around git, so commit, blame, and revert are right at your fingertips.</p>

<h3>Your Git workflow, anywhere</h3>

<p>Pull, edit, and commit for free, on any iOS device. Connect your GitHub or bitbucket account for instant access to your public and private repos. Generate and upload a public key for password-free authentication. View diffs before committing, ignore files, and be a git master without a command-line.</p>

<h3>Advanced Git support: Branch, Push, Merge</h3>

<p>Does <code>git push heroku master</code> mean something to you? What about a <code>gh-pages</code> branch? With an optional in-app purchase, Clone can push your repos and communicate with multiple remotes. When merge conflicts happen, Clone helps there too.</p>

<h3>Powerful integrations: <code>git init</code> to github.com in seconds</h3>

<p>After connecting to your Github or Bitbucket account, you can clone your repos without typing a thing. With an optional in-app purchase, repos you create on your device can be published to GitHub or bitbucket in seconds. Fix a bug, start a blog, or think bigger.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Split view and slide over require compatible iPads</li>
<li>Push, management of remotes, and publishing to code hosting services require an in-app purchase.</li>
</ul>
