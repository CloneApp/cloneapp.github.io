# Clone

## `git remote add iphone|ipad|ipad-pro` 

Clone brings the power of Git version control to iOS, in an intelligent package. With beautiful visualization, an advanced code editor, and intuitive git workflows, Clone makes git productivity mobile.

## Features

### Top-notch visualization

A graph is worth a thousand SHAs. Clone shows commit history beautifully and quickly, so you can **see** what that merge commit actually merges. See what changed in amy commit with diff views. For individual files a heat map (blame) shows the who, what and when for each part of the file when you're asking **why**.

### Designed for iPad Pro and iOS 9

Clone works beautifully on all iOS devices, but bigger is better. With multitasking on iPad, you can work side-by-side. Write a blog post in Markdown from one app while previewing in Clone. Commit and push are just a tap away. Whatever the size, you're covered.

### A Code Editor tailored for git

Be fearless with version control. Clone's text editor previews HTML and [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). It performs syntax highlighting in 30+ languages and displays line numbers. It's built around git, so commit, blame, and revert are right at your fingertips.

### Your Git workflow, anywhere

Pull, edit, and commit for free, on any iOS device. Connect your GitHub or bitbucket account for instant access to your public and private repos. Generate and upload a public key for password-free authentication. View diffs before committing, ignore files, and be a git master without a command-line.

### Advanced Git support: Branch, Push, Merge

Does `git push heroku master` mean something to you? What about a `gh-pages` branch? With an optional in-app purchase, Clone can push your repos and communicate with multiple remotes. When merge conflicts happen, Clone helps there too.

### Powerful integrations: `git init` to github.com in seconds

After connecting to your Github or Bitbucket account, you can clone your repos without typing a thing. With an optional in-app purchase, repos you create on your device can be published to GitHub or bitbucket in seconds. Fix a bug, start a blog, or think bigger.

Notes:

- Split view and slide over require compatible iPads
- Push, management of remotes, and publishing to code hosting services require an in-app purchase.
